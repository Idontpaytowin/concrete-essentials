# ConcreteEssentials

In normal Minecraft, it's long to create concrete. So this mod makes it easier and I think, that it will help a lot.

[Releases Tab](https://github.com/Idontpaytowin/concrete-essentials/releases)

## The mod is compatible with Forge 35.1.0+

The description doesn't have to be long, right?
